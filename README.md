## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Gradients

### What I learned

I practiced the use of pure css and the handling of form data with vanilla javascript. The point where I had the most difficulty was with the radio type inputs, managing their styles was something I hadn't done, I really learned a lot on this project despite how small it is*

### Continued development

I would like to improve my ability to handle the DOM with Vanilla JavaScript and increase my knowledge of less common concepts in CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla MDN Web Docs | input type="radio"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio) - This resource was very useful, it helped me understand how the radio inputs work..
- [CSS Gradient](https://www.example.com) - Very useful and simple web app for creating gradients.
